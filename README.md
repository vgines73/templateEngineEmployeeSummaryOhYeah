## Test Instructions:

1. Go to my Github profile and clone the template engine employee summary repository onto your computer using gitbash.
2. Open it up in vs code and open up your terminal.
3. Install inquirer and jest.
4. Once installed, in your terminal, run node.app.js. This will open up a series of prompts for the user to answer to create their team on the HTML page.

## Challenges:

Testing was a challenge. When I first started the assignment, we didn't go over class constructors yet. Once I learned that, testing was easier to pass. As for generating the prompts for each employee, I just mimicked how I did the read me generator assignment, but realized it wouldn't work and I needed to separate each type of employee with its own prompts. Then I had issues with syntax with generating the HTML. After I figured that out, I had issues with all the cards in one row, but fixed it using flex wrap. Looked lit with 3 employees on the page, but didn't when I generated 5 like in the example. Speaking of the example, I was going off of the readme and the examples given in the readme were broken, so I didn't know what to expect, and wrote my code based on what it was asking. I didn't realize until much later, there was an Assets folder which contained the working screenshots. I didn't know office number referred to a room number, instead I made it a phone number where they can click on the link to make the call, and I also gave them unique ID numbers. Since I was using NBA players for my example, I decided to give them their jersey number as their ID.
